#### Overview

This three-month roadmap is designed to provide a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python. The roadmap is structured to guide you from the basics of text processing to advanced techniques involving deep learning and large language models. By the end of this roadmap, you will have the skills required to tackle real-world NLP problems and build state-of-the-art NLP models.

#### Objectives

- **Fundamental Understanding:** Gain a solid foundation in NLP concepts and techniques.
- **Practical Skills:** Develop hands-on skills in implementing and fine-tuning NLP models using popular libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and PyTorch.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Learn advanced deep learning techniques and how to apply them to NLP tasks.
- **Real-World Applications:** Work on practical projects and case studies that reflect real-world NLP applications.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Understand the ethical implications of NLP and how to develop responsible AI solutions.

#### Who Should follow this repo?

This repo is ideal for:
